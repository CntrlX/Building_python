# Lessons Learned

[2024-07-14 15:30] Error Handling: Implemented robust try-except blocks in dataset loading and training loop → Prevents training failure due to individual sample errors → Critical for handling real-world datasets with occasional corrupted samples or annotation issues.

[2024-07-14 15:45] Memory Management: Added image size checking and resizing for large images exceeding 4000 pixels → Prevents CUDA out of memory errors during training → Important for datasets with variable image sizes and helps maintain consistent training performance.

[2024-07-14 16:00] Logging: Enhanced logging system with both console and file handlers → Provides detailed error tracebacks and progress information → Essential for diagnosing issues in complex training pipelines and provides audit trail for debugging.

[2024-07-14 16:15] Synthetic Annotations: Implemented fallback to synthetic annotations when real annotations are missing → Enables training with partially labeled datasets → Improves model generalization by utilizing more training data even when fully labeled data is limited.

[2024-07-14 16:30] Command-line Interface: Standardized command-line arguments across batch and PowerShell scripts → Provides consistent user experience across different Windows environments → Reduces confusion and makes the system more accessible to users with different preferences.

[2024-07-14 16:45] Validation Process: Modified validation to continue despite individual sample errors → Provides more complete evaluation metrics → Prevents validation from failing completely due to a single problematic sample, giving more representative performance assessment.

[2024-07-14 17:00] Documentation: Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide and updated README → Makes common issues and solutions easily accessible → Reduces support burden and enables users to self-diagnose and resolve problems without developer intervention.
