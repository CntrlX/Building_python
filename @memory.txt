# Memory File for Mask-Aware Semi-Supervised Object Detection Project

## Project Overview
- Working on a semi-supervised object detection model implementation
- Located at /z:/Code/AcuteAngle/building-ai-agent/python/odm
- Goal is to improve error handling, logging, and user experience

## Key Files
- odm/main.py: Main entry point with command-line interface
- odm/utils/trainer.py: Contains training and evaluation logic
- odm/utils/dataset.py: Dataset implementation with enhanced error handling
- odm/train.bat: Windows batch file for running training
- odm/train.ps1: PowerShell script for running training

## Recent Changes
- Updated training script to include better error handling during validation
- Modified dataset loading to handle large images and improve error reporting
- Enhanced training loop to continue despite individual batch errors
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Updated README.md with improved documentation
- Updated train.bat with enhanced command-line interface
- Updated train.ps1 to match functionality of train.bat

## Command-line Options
- --mode [train|val|test]: Mode to run
- --device [cuda|cpu]: Device to use
- --label-percentage VALUE: Percentage of labeled data
- --batch-size VALUE: Batch size for training
- --resume: Resume training from checkpoint
- --use-synthetic: Use synthetic annotations
- --model-path PATH: Path to model for validation/testing
- --image-path PATH: Path to image for testing
- --test: Run synthetic annotation test
- --debug: Enable debug output

## Current Task
- Updated PowerShell script (train.ps1) to match batch file functionality
- Both scripts now provide consistent interface across Windows environments
